Welcome to my blog! I'm Sambhav, a Software Engineer and SDET with over 5 years of experience building and testing software.

## Why a Blog?

I've been meaning to share my learnings for a while now. Whether it's a neat test automation pattern, a debugging war story, or thoughts on software quality — writing helps me solidify what I know and hopefully helps others too.

## What I'll Write About

- **Test automation** strategies, patterns, and frameworks
- **Software engineering** best practices and lessons learned
- **Tools and frameworks** I use daily (Playwright, Selenium, Spring Boot, Django, and more)
- **Career insights** from my journey as an SDET
- **Open source** contributions and community involvement
