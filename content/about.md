## Extracurricular Activities/ Volunteership ü•∑üèº

1. **Smart India Hackathon**  --- **2017**
    - First nationwide hackathon organised by Govt of India.
    - Our head of department (during my bachelors) selected me and one friend of mine from the entire class to join a team of 3 seniors for this hackathon.
    - Our team made a Django project titled 'Petrol Pump Locator' which could be used by people to locate nearby petrol pumps around their location.
    - Me and my friend worked on the frontend part of the project while others worked on the backend. But we did tinker around with Django's configuration.
    - Honestly, it was a thrilling experience where interest for application programming grew for me.
    - Having said that, it was a bit overwhelming too, since we were not that good at coding at that point of time, but we did get alot of exposure.

2. **Code Club Member, SSEC**  --- **2019**
    - SSEC is short for my college - Shri Shankaracharya Engineering College, Bhilai.
